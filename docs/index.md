## Daily social mapping project happening every November

!!! note "Upcoming challenge!"
    **Categories for 2024 challenge coming here soon!**

The official repository for #30DayMapChallenge, a daily mapping challenge open to everyone.

The idea is to create maps based around different themes each day of November using the hashtag `#30DayMapChallenge`. You can prepare the maps beforehand, but the main idea is to publish maps on the dedicated days. Just include a picture of the map when you post to Twitter (or other platforms) with the hashtag. You don't have to sign up anywhere to participate. There are no restrictions on the tools, technologies or the data you use in your maps. Doing less than 30 is also fine. 

## Code of Conduct
No matter if you are a GIS expert or never made a map before this challenge, everyone is welcome to participate,

But keep in mind a few things:
- All maps you publish have to be **your original work**. Don’t steal content from others.
- Give **credit to the original data source** whenever possible.
- The challenge is all about **creativity, openness and the joy of beautiful maps and cartography.** It is not a competition,
- Be mindful in how you use AI tooling. If you generate all of your maps with generative AI tools, where's the fun? This is not a prompt engineering challenge. 
- **Don’t be an asshole**. Don’t harass or steal from others.

Inspiration for the challenge came from [Inktober](https://inktober.com/) and [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).
